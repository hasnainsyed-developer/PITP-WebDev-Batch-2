    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Syed Ghulam Rasool Shah Lakyari, and I am a dedicated and passionate Web Developer who loves learning new things every single day. Web development inspires me because it combines creativity with logic, and it allows me to turn ideas into real digital experiences.<br><br>

        I consider myself a self-motivated learner. I enjoy understanding how websites work, how layouts are designed, and how user experiences are created. Every day, I try to learn something new—whether it’s a new coding trick, a design technique, or a better way to solve a problem.<br><br>

        My goal is to become a professional and highly skilled web developer who can create modern, clean, and user-friendly websites. I believe success comes with consistency, and I follow this rule in my coding journey. I always try to improve my skills and push myself toward becoming better than yesterday.<br><br>

        I love creating websites that look beautiful and work smoothly on all devices. I pay attention to small details like colors, spacing, animations, and layout balance. I want every project I make to reflect my creativity and hard work.<br><br>

        In the future, I want to learn advanced JavaScript, frameworks like React, and UI/UX design to create even better and more powerful web applications. I want to grow in this field and make a successful career in web development.<br><br>

        Outside of coding, I am a simple and positive person. I enjoy learning new technologies, watching coding videos, and practicing small projects in my free time. Every small step brings me closer to my goals, and I am excited about my future as a developer.<br><br>

        This is just the beginning of my journey, and I am ready to work hard, stay consistent, and become the best version of myself in the world of web development.<br><br>

⭐ HTML (HyperText Markup Language) <br><br>

HTML is the basic building block of every website. <br>
It provides the structure of a webpage, just like bones in the human body. <br><br>

With HTML we can: <br><br>

Add headings, paragraphs, images, links <br>
Create lists, tables, forms <br>
Organize the content properly <br><br>

HTML is the first step of web development and it defines what will appear on the screen.

<p class="css-info" id="css">
⭐ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) <br><br>

CSS is used for styling and designing the website. <br>
It decides how the website will look. <br><br>

CSS helps in: <br><br>

Adding colors <br>
Changing fonts <br>
Designing layouts <br>
Creating animations <br>
Making the website responsive <br><br>

Without CSS, every website would look plain and simple.  
CSS adds beauty and life to webpages.
